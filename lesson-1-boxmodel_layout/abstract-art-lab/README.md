# Abstract Art Lab
## Unit 1 - Lesson 1: The Box Model and Layout Foundations

### Objective
* Reuben is an aspiring artist 👨🏿‍🎨. He specializes in abstract art. He has designed a piece that he hopes to sell for enough 💰💰💰 to fund the rest of the year at the Marcy Lab School but first, he needs his Fellows to draw this up on plain old HTML and CSS.
* Your task is to [**recreate this mockup**](https://www.figma.com/proto/ntceKrzARY1rJfqGf0Vl2m/Box-Model-Lab-Abstract-Art?node-id=1%3A2&scaling=min-zoom) in HTML/CSS.
* You will have to rely on your display properties and understanding of the Box Model in order to produce a **pixel perfect** recreation!
* **Note**: There are no customizations allowed for this lab🙅🏿‍♂️. In order to pass, your project must pass the _blink test_.

### Directions
1. Create a new project locally. The project should be named `abstract-art-lab`.
2. Initialize the directory as a Git repository.
3. Create a remote repository on GitHub with the exact same name.
4. Follow the directions on GitHub to ensure that it is the remote repository for your local repo.
5. Create an `index.html` file and a `style.css` file. Connect them and recreate the project!
6. Commit your changes regularly.
7. When you have finished the project, submit the link to your repository on Google Classroom.
